=======================

Simple physics simulation demo using Box2DWeb

Base on this exercise: 

A firecracker is shot into the air. It needs to reach a height of 90m at the top of its flight. What does its initial velocity 
have to be to do this? 
 
Given: 
 90m = Î”d (the change in distance) 
 ? = vi (initial velocity) 
 A = -9.81 m/s^2 (acceleration upward due to gravity ONLY) 
 Vf = 0 m/s (final velocity) 
 
 0^2 = vi^2 + 2 * (-9.81) * 90 
 vi = 42.02 m/s
